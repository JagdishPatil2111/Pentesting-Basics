# What is a Web Server?

- A web server is an application that runs on the back-end server, which handles all of the HTTP traffic from the client-side browser, routes it to the requests destination pages, and finally responds to the client-side browser. 
- Web servers usually run on TCP ports 80 or 443, and are responsible for connecting end-users to various parts of the web application, in addition to handling their various responses:.
- As web applications tend to be open for public interaction and facing the internet, they may lead to the back-end server being compromised if they suffer from any vulnerabilities. Web applications can provide a vast attack surface, making them a high-value target for attackers and pentesters.
- Web application security assessment methodologies are often based around the [OWASP top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) as a starting point for the top categories of flaws that an assessor should be checking for.
