# What is a Shell?
- **On a Linux system, the shell is a program that takes input from the user via the keyboard and passes these commands to the operating system to perform a specific function.**
- **Many operating system types and versions have emerged along with the graphic user interface (GUI) to complement command-line interfaces (shell), such as the Linux terminal, Windows command-line (cmd.exe), and Windows PowerShell.**
- **Most Linux systems use a program called `Bash (Bourne Again Shell)` as a shell program to interact with the operating system. Bash is an enhanced version of `sh`, the Unix systems' original shell program. Aside from bash there are also other shells, including but not limited to Zsh, Tcsh, Ksh, Fish shell, etc.**
