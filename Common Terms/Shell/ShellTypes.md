# Types of Shells:
- **We will often read about or hear others talking about "getting a shell" on a box (system).**
- **This means that the target host has been exploited, and we have obtained shell-level access (typically bash or sh) and can run commands interactively as if we are sitting logged in to the host.** 
- **A shell may be obtained by exploiting a web application or network/service vulnerability or obtaining credentials and logging into the target host remotely.**
- **There are three main types of shell connections:**


| **Shell Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Reverse Shell | Initiates a connection back to a "listener" on our attack box. |
| Bind Shell | "Binds" to a specific port on the target host and waits for a connection from our attack box. |
| Web Shell | Runs operating system commands via the web browser, typically not interactive or semi-interactive. It can also be used to run single commands (i.e., leveraging a file upload vulnerability and uploading a PHP script to run a single command. |

- **Each type of shell has its use case, and the same way there are many ways to obtain a shell, the helper program that we use to get a shell can be written in many languages (Python, Perl, Go, Bash, Java, awk, PHP, etc.).**
- **These can be small scripts or larger, more complex programs to facilitate a connection from the target host back to our attacking system and obtain "shell" access.**
