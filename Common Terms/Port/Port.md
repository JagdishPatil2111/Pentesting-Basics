# What is a Port?

- Ports are virtual points where network connections begin and end
- They are software-based and managed by host operating system
-  Ports are associated with a specific process or service and allow computers to differentiate between different traffic types (SSH traffic flows to a different port than web requests to access a website even though the access requests are sent over the same network connection).
-  Each port is assigned a number, and many are standardized across all network-connected devices (though a service can be configured to run on a non-standard port).
-  For example, HTTP messages (website traffic) typically go to port 80, while HTTPS messages go to port 443 unless configured otherwise.
-  We will encounter web applications running on non-standard ports but typically find them on ports 80 and 443. Port numbers allow us to access specific services or applications running on target devices.
-  At a very high level, ports help computers understand how to handle the various types of data they receive.

# Categories of Ports

- `TCP` is connection-oriented meaning that a connection between a client and a server must be established before data can be sent. The server must be in a listening state awaiting connection requests from clients.
- `UDP` utilizes a connectionless communication model. There is no "handshake" and therefore introduces a certain amount of unreliability since there is no guarantee of data delivery. 
- `UDP` is suitable for applications that run time-sensitive tasks since dropping packets is faster than waiting for delayed packets due to retransmission, as is the case with `TCP` and can significantly affect a real-time system.
- There are `65,535 TCP` ports and `65,535 different UDP` ports, each denoted by a number. Some of the most well-known TCP and UDP ports are listed below:

| Port(s) | Protocol |
| --- | --- |
| 20/21 (TCP) |	FTP |
| 22 (TCP) | SSH |
| 23 (TCP) | Telnet |
| 25 (TCP) | SMTP |
| 80 (TCP) | HTTP |
| 161 (TCP/UDP) | SNMP |
| 389 (TCP/UDP) |	LDAP |
| 443 (TCP) |	SSL/TLS (HTTPS) |
| 445 (TCP) |	SMB |
| 3389 (TCP) |	RDP |
| 88 (TCP/UDP) | Kerberos Auth. |
