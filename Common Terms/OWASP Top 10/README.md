# [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

- OWASP Top 10 is a standardized list of the top 10 web application vulnerabilities maintained by the `Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)`.
- This list is considered the top 10 most dangerous vulnerabilities and is not an exhaustive list of all possible web application vulnerabilities. 
- Web application security assessment methodologies are often based around the OWASP top 10 as a starting point for the top categories of flaws that an assessor should be checking for. The current OWASP Top 10 list is:


| Number | Category | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. |  	Injection |	SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection, etc. |
| 2. |	Broken Authentication |	Authentication and session management misconfigurations can lead to unauthorized access to an application through password guessing attacks or improper session timeout, among other issues. |
| 3. |  	Sensitive Data Exposure |	Improperly protecting data such as financial, healthcare, or personally identifiable information. |
| 4. |  	XML External Entities (XXE) 	|Poorly configured XML processors that can lead to internal file disclosure, port scanning, remote code execution, or denial of service attacks. |
| 5. | Broken Access Control |	Restrictions are not appropriately implemented to prevent users from accessing other users accounts, viewing sensitive data, accessing unauthorized functionality, modifying data, etc. |
| 6. | Security Misconfiguration | Insecure default configurations, open cloud storage, verbose error messages which disclose too much information. |
| 7. | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) |	XSS occurs when an application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the execution of HTML or JavaScript in a victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, website defacement, redirecting a user to a malicious website, etc. |
| 8. |  	Insecure Deserialization |	This flaw often leads to remote code execution, injection attacks, or privilege escalation attacks. |
| 9. |  	Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities |	All of the components used by an application (libraries, frameworks, software modules) run with the same privilege as the application. If the application uses components with known flaws, it may lead to sensitive data exposure or remote code execution. |
| 10. |  	Insufficient Logging & Monitoring |	Deficiencies in logging & monitoring may allow a successful attack to go unnoticed, for attackers to establish persistence in the network, or tamper with or extract sensitive data without being noticed. |
