# Using SSH

- SSH uses a client-server model, connecting a user running an SSH client application such as OpenSSH to an SSH server. 
- While attacking a box or during a real-world assessment, we often obtain cleartext credentials or an SSH private key that can be leveraged to connect directly to a system via SSH. 
- An SSH connection is typically much more stable than a reverse shell connection and can often be used as a "jump host" to enumerate and attack other hosts in the network, transfer tools, set up persistence, etc. 
- If we obtain a set of credentials, we can use SSH to login remotely to the server by using the username @ the remote server IP, as follows:\
`SJ@htb[/htb]$ ssh Bob@10.10.10.10`\
`Bob@remotehost's password: *********`\
`Bob@remotehost#`
- It is also possible to read local private keys on a compromised system or add our public key to gain SSH access to a specific user.
- As we can see, SSH is an excellent tool for securely connecting to a remote machine. It also provides a way for mapping local ports on the remote machine to our localhost, which can become handy at times.
