# SSH

- Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that runs on port 22 by default and provides users such as system administrators a secure way to access a computer remotely. 
- SSH can be configured with password authentication or passwordless using public-key authentication using an SSH public/private key pair.
- SSH can be used to remotely access systems on the same network, over the internet, facilitate connections to resources in other networks using port forwarding/proxying, and upload/download files to and from remote systems.
