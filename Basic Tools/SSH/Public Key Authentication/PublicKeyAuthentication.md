# Public Key Authentication

- Public key authentication is a way of logging into an SSH/SFTP(Secure FTP) account using a cryptographic key rather than a password.
- If you use very strong SSH/SFTP passwords, your accounts are already safe from brute force attacks. However, using public key authentication provides many benefits when working with multiple developers.
- For example, 

  1. allow multiple developers to log in as the same system user without having to share a single password between them;
  2. revoke a single developer's access without revoking access by other developers; and
  3. make it easier for a single developer to log in to many accounts without needing to manage many different passwords.

# How it works?

- Keys come in pairs of a public key and a private key. Each key pair is unique, and the two keys work together.
- These two keys have a very special and beautiful mathematical property: if you have the private key, you can prove you have it without showing what it is. 
- It's like proving you know a password without having to show someone the password.
- Public key authentication works like this,

  1. Generate a key pair
  2. Give someone (or a server) the public key.
  3. Later, anytime you want to authenticate, the person (or the server) asks you to prove you have the private key that corresponds to the public key.
  4. You prove you have the private key.
