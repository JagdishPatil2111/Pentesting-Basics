# Socat

- Another similar network utility like `netcat` is `socat`, which has a few features that netcat does not support, like forwarding ports and connecting to serial devices.
- Socat can also be used to upgrade a shell to a fully interactive TTY. We will see a few examples of this in a later section. 
- Socat is a very handy utility that should be a part of every penetration tester's toolkit. 
- A standalone binary of Socat can be transferred to a system after obtaining remote code execution to get a more stable reverse shell connection.
