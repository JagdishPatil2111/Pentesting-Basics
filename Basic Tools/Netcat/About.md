# Using Netcat

- Netcat, ncat, or nc, is an excellent network utility for interacting with TCP/UDP ports. It can be used for many things during a pentest.
- Its primary usage is for connecting to shells, which we'll discuss later in this module. In addition to that, netcat can be used to connect to any listening port and interact with the service running on that port.
- For example, SSH is programmed to handle connections over port 22 to send all data and keys. We can connect to TCP port 22 with netcat:\
  `DevilSJ@htb[/htb]$ netcat 10.10.10.10 22`

  `SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Debian-3`
- As we can see, port 22 sent us its banner, stating that SSH is running on it. This technique is called Banner Grabbing, and can help identify what service is running on a particular port.
- Windows alternative to netcat coded in PowerShell called PowerCat. Netcat can also be used to transfer files between machines.
